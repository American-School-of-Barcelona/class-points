# class-points

This is a "class point system that is goated", according to Mathis.

## Overview

For the frontend, this project makes use of [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) & [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).
For the backend, we chose Rust using the [tokio](https://tokio.rs/), [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), and [diesel](https://diesel.rs/)
libraries for full async functionality and request handling.

Per project specifications, the database is just standard [sqlite](https://sqlite.org/).
